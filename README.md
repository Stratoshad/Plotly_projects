This repo will have various fun plotly projects that I am working on my spare time. The aim of this is to get common out-of-the box visuals that either implemented in static visualisations e.g. Matplotlib or Seaborn or in other languages such as R and make them again using the interractive Plotly library. This repo will be using Python 3.6+
